Hello Connections! I would like to share my project made in Python-Flask. It is a blog where a person/admin can writes regularly about topics that interest them, very easily and efficiently .I  had shared all the operations and features available in the blog , in the video attached to this post.

I had used

1. Clean blog template by @bootstrap for front end.

2. Flask for the backend

3. MySQL database for storing posts and contact details.

4. XAMP for providing localhost server and MySQL.

GitHub repo link https://github.com/arpit456jain/CodesmashersBlog-In-Flask

Give it a star if like it.
